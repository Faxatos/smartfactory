Bar Chart  
  - ID: `bar_chart` 
  - Description: Represents data using rectangular bars with heights proportional to the values they represent. It is optimized for comparing discrete values or categories, such as counts, costs, or quantities divided by category.  
 
- Line Chart  
  - ID: `line_chart`  
  - Description: Displays data as a series of points connected by lines. It is ideal for showing trends over time or relationships between continuous variables, such as energy consumption, temperature variations, or performance over time.  
 
- Pie Chart  
  - ID: `pie_chart`  
  - Description: Represents data as slices of a circle, where each slice corresponds to a percentage of the total. It is optimized for visualizing proportions or relative distributions, such as the percentage of consumption by machine or cost distribution.  
 
- Scatter Plot  
  - ID: `scatter_plot`  
  - Description: Displays data as a collection of points on a Cartesian plane. It is optimized for analyzing the relationship between two continuous variables, such as working time and energy consumption, or for identifying outliers and trends.  
 
Here are three additional types of graphs with their descriptions:
 
- Histogram  
  - ID: `histogram`  
  - Description: Represents the distribution of a dataset by dividing the range of data into intervals (bins) and displaying the frequency of data points within each bin. It is ideal for understanding the shape, spread, and central tendency of continuous data, such as machine cycle times or temperature readings.  
 
- Area Chart  
  - ID: `area_chart`  
  - Description: Similar to a line chart but with the area below the line filled in to emphasize the magnitude of values over time. It is optimized for showing cumulative trends or comparisons between multiple data series, such as total production output or energy usage.  
 
- Stacked Bar Chart  
  - ID: `stacked_bar_chart`  
  - Description: Extends the bar chart by stacking bars for different subcategories on top of each other to show both the total and the contribution of each subcategory. It is ideal for comparing parts of a whole across multiple categories, such as machine downtime reasons or production volumes by shift.
