--------------------------------- NEW KPI GENERATION ---------------------------------


USER QUERY: "Create a new KPI that stores the bad cycles ratio"

INSTRUCTION: 
"Using the contextual information from the already computed KPIs, calculate the new KPI requested by the user following the same format of the contextual ones. About the computable KPIs you receive in input:
- ID: the ID representing the KPI (eg: power_consumption_efficiency)
- Atomic: a boolean value that represent if the KPI formula is atomic or it requires other KPIs to be computed (eg: false)
- Description: Brief text description that represent what the KPI compute (eg: This indicator calculates the energy efficiency of a specific machine in a given time interval)
- Formula (base): the basic formula of the KPI (power_consumption_efficiency = working_time_sum / consumption_sum)
- Formula (atomic): if the base formula contains non atomic KPIs this formula simplify all terms to obtain only atomic ones (power_consumption_efficiency = working_time_sum / consumption_sum)
- Unit of Measure: (eg %, Kw, m)
- Domain: min, max and type of the value

Give me only the best suitable formula possible.
